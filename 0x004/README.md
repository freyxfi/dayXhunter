# Day 4 

- Today was the last day of my pentesterlab sub now I got 9 certs from it I did not completed all the labs in the starting I though I will do all source code and everything but then as I am a web sec guy I got hooked with all that api and other web related topics but still cool journey I completed more and 250+ labs and got 9 certs. 
it was cool but I still belive it can be better as exceprt from android one and that wireshrk one it was nothing that I don't know there if I think it is cool but it should be updated right. its been as same as for many years now. but still overall that was a good thing too do 
- Now I am all in hunting and locked in lets see how December will go also I will be busy on 3rd and 4th of Dec cause of CTF 
- Message for future frey ( you got this bro there are lots of famous people who made it by their own no support no shit just pure self made ego. )
