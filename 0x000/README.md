## ✅ Day 0x001 — Log

Ahh, so I actually started this!

Let’s talk about what I did today and how I did it:

- **5 AM run**  running fast in that high AQI (might die soon 💀)
- **TryHackMe  Intro to Threat Emulation (Completed!)**  
  Room: https://tryhackme.com/room/threatemulationintro  
  *(There’s a cool game inside, btw.)*
- **SAML basics + understanding the authentication flow**  
  Tool used: https://github.com/CompassSecurity/SAMLRaider  
  It makes life *so* much easier.
- **Planning to create an authentication checklist**  
  I waste a lot of time checking the same functionality repeatedly.
- **Reading bug bounty reports**  
  (These will go into the `reports` section.)
- **Cyberpunk 2077 time** 🎮
- **Scouting some big organizations**  
  But setting everything up will take a little time.

Since this is Day 1 I think I should pick a target and properly set up my machine.  
Let’s see how things go tomorrow.
